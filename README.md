# Crime Association Rules Learning in the City of Atlanta

Data mining and machine learning have become a vital part of crime detection and prevention. Crime in Atlanta, Georgia is above the national median and has been a major problem for the city since the middle twentieth century. 

The main motivation for our project was how easily the crime data could be available form credible sources. This was a big plus as we then could develop any kind of system to assist the city officials. In the past, due to inadequate data collection and surveillance techniques, it was difficult to recognize a pattern to these daily crimes, much less apprehend the criminals behind these violations. As mentioned earlier, now we have access to data that is produced every second of everyday. On top of that, there is a systematic way of recording and storing these data so as not to tamper with it or loose it. All the collected data can help us understand more about the crimes in the city and help us better understand our living, working and studying environment in cities, in this case, Atlanta city. By analyzing data in a mathematically way, the researcher can gain access into the deep reasons behind the causes of crime and be able to predict future crimes before their occurrence.

## Proposed Work

The Projects main aim was to be able to analyze the crimes happening all around in Atlanta and be able to form an association as to where and when certain types of crimes normally happen. The project can form association rules between the time of the crime reported, the location of the crime and the type of crime that happened. This enables us to discover a pattern of the crime and may help users take precaution measures to avoid it. Some of the crimes that seem common are in fact something the users could have avoided, if the patterns of the crimes are studied. The criminals usually tend to follow a certain pattern when doing a crime, like the locations where the crime happened or the time during which the crimes happens. Studying and analyzing the patterns can help the citizens of that city be a step ahead and try preventing it from happening. The visualizations developed would be able to translate the results achieved. They would be able to better show the changes in the data.


## Development Platform and libraries

We implemented the entire project using Python as the development platform. The selection of python over other platforms was python was extremely scalable as compared to platforms like R and it is faster. Python has several data science libraries that make the development very easy for the developer. We used several python libraries for the entire implementation process, they include: matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, numpy, shapely, descartes and geopandas. Shapely, descartes and geopandas were the libraries used to generate the visualisations translated from the results obtained.
